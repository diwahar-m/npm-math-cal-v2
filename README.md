This package can do operation like addition, subtraction ,multiplication and division. 

I created this package for a practice purpose only. 

For  addition => 

import {addition} from 'math-cal-v2';

console.log(addition(2, 3)); // 5 

Like above operation, we can do it for  subtraction, multiplication, division.
